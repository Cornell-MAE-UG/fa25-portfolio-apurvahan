I worked on the final stages of dissection with my part of my group in the Friday discussion section and we took apart the outer casing as well as the electronic components and the motor to see if we could find any more paths for fluid flow. Afterward, when making the video, I worked with my groupmates to figure out out final theories for how the device works and specifically why the impeller shapes are designed the way they are. I then drew the diagram of our system with the arrows for where fluid goes. Ana and I worked on the final calculations for flow and Reynolds number and then I worked on the slide I presented and recorded.
