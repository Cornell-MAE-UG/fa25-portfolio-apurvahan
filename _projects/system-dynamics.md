Abstract: We are going to analyze the system response of a massage gun because, as students with aching muscles, our closest confidant is the massage gun. We expect it to be a second-order vibrational ODE system with a disturbance input coming from the interaction with the muscle and a step response coming from different speeds/modes that the massage gun may have. We will evaluate whether it is an open-loop or closed-loop system, as massage guns can be both, and we will have to evaluate which one this particular massage gun is. By making a block diagram, identifying the controls, and testing out different settings, we will be able to estimate the output.
